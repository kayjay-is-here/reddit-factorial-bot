# SETUP

The source code is within `/src`, the actual program is in `/build`.
You must fill in the file in the /config folder in the same directory as `bot.js`
called `config.json`. afterwards, simply do `> node bot.js` inside the `/build` directory.
of course, you need node installed beforehand, but you won't need any dependencies.

# Notes
> why the hell is .vscode not disapearing when i put it in .gitignore!?
I'm considering running this bot on my own, or hosting it somewhere. but in the meantime, the code is available to anyone who wants to use it.

Feel free to make pull requests, I have a lot of other things to work on.
