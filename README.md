# SETUP

The source code is within `/src`, the actual program is in `/build`.
You must fill in the file in the /config folder in the same directory as `bot.js`
called `config.json`. afterwards, simply do `> node bot.js` inside the `/build` directory.
of course, you need node installed beforehand, but you won't need any dependencies.
